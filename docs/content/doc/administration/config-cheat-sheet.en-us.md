# Configuration Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet for the Gitea configuration file. It contains most of the settings
that can be configured as well as their default values.

Any changes to the Gitea configuration file should be made in `custom/conf/app.ini`
or any corresponding location. When installing from a distribution, this will
typically be found at `/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini`.

The defaults provided here are best-effort (not built automatically). They are
accurately recorded in [app.example.ini](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/main/custom/conf/app.example.ini)
(s/main/\<tag|release\>). Any string in the format `%(X)s` is a feature powered
by [ini](https://github.com/go-ini/ini/#recursive-values), for reading values recursively.

In the default values below, a value in the form `$XYZ` refers to an environment variable. (However, see `environment-to-ini`.) Values in the form  _`XxYyZz`_ refer to values listed as part of the default configuration. These notation forms will not work in your own `app.ini` file and are only listed here as documentation.

Values containing `#` or `;` must be quoted using `` ` `` or `"""`.

**Note:** A full restart is required for Gitea configuration changes to take effect.

## Default Configuration (non-`app.ini` configuration)

These values are environment-dependent but form the basis of a lot of values. They will be
reported as part of the default configuration when running `gitea --help` or on start-up. The order they are emitted there is slightly different but we will list them here in the order they are set-up.

- _`AppPath`_: This is the absolute path of the running gitea binary.
- _`AppWorkPath`_: This refers to "working path" of the `gitea` binary. It is determined by using the first set thing in the following hierarchy:
  - The `--work-path` flag passed to the binary
  - The environment variable `$GITEA_WORK_DIR`
  - A built-in value set at build time (see building from source)
  - Otherwise it defaults to the directory of the _`AppPath`_
  - If any of the above are relative paths then they are made absolute against
the directory of the _`AppPath`_
- _`CustomPath`_: This is the base directory for custom templates and other options.
It is determined by using the first set thing in the following hierarchy:
  - The `--custom-path` flag passed to the binary
  - The environment variable `$GITEA_CUSTOM`
  - A built-in value set at build time (see building from source)
  - Otherwise it defaults to _`AppWorkPath`_`/custom`
  - If any of the above are relative paths then they are made absolute against the
the directory of the _`AppWorkPath`_
- _`CustomConf`_: This is the path to the `app.ini` file.
  - The `--config` flag passed to the binary
  - A built-in value set at build time (see building from source)
  - Otherwise it defaults to _`CustomPath`_`/conf/app.ini`
  - If any of the above are relative paths then they are made absolute against the
the directory of the _`CustomPath`_

In addition there is _`StaticRootPath`_ which can be set as a built-in at build time, but will otherwise default to _`AppWorkPath`_

## Overall (`DEFAULT`)

- `APP_NAME`: **Gitea: Git with a cup of tea**: Application name, used in the page title.
- `RUN_USER`: **_current OS username_/`$USER`/`$USERNAME` e.g. git**: The user Gitea will run as.
   This should be a dedicated system (non-user) account. Setting this incorrectly will cause Gitea
   to not start.
- `RUN_MODE`: **prod**: Application run mode, affects performance and debugging. Either "dev", "prod" or "test".

## Repository (`repository`)

- `ROOT`: **%(APP_DATA_PATH)s/gitea-repositories**: Root path for storing all repository data.
   A relative path is interpreted as **_`AppWorkPath`_/%(ROOT)s**.

   Overwrite this option to request static resources from a different URL.
   This includes CSS files, images, JS files and web fonts.
   Avatar images are dynamic resources and still served by Gitea.
   The option can be just a different path, as in `/static`, or another domain, as in `https://cdn.example.com`.
   Requests are then made as `%(ROOT_URL)s/static/assets/css/index.css` or `https://cdn.example.com/assets/css/index.css` respectively.
   The static files are located in the `public/` directory of the Gitea source repository.
   You can proxy the STATIC_URL_PREFIX requests to Gitea server to serve the static
   assets, or copy the manually built Gitea assets from `$GITEA_BUILD/public` to
   the assets location, eg: `/var/www/assets`, make sure `$STATIC_URL_PREFIX/assets/css/index.css`
   points to `/var/www/assets/css/index.css`.

- `HTTP_PORT`: **3000**: HTTP listen port.
  - If `PROTOCOL` is set to `fcgi`, Gitea will listen for FastCGI requests on TCP socket
     defined by `HTTP_ADDR` and `HTTP_PORT` configuration settings.

- `LOCAL_ROOT_URL`: **%(PROTOCOL)s://%(HTTP_ADDR)s:%(HTTP_PORT)s/**: Local
   (DMZ) URL for Gitea workers (such as SSH update) accessing web service. In
   most cases you do not need to change the default value. Alter it only if
   your SSH server node is not the same as HTTP node. Do not set this variable
   if `PROTOCOL` is set to `http+unix`.
- `LOCAL_USE_PROXY_PROTOCOL`: **%(USE_PROXY_PROTOCOL)s**: When making local connections pass the PROXY protocol header.
   This should be set to false if the local connection will go through the proxy.

When empty no file will be created and `SSH_AUTHORIZED_PRINCIPALS_ALLOW` will default to `off`.
- `SSH_TRUSTED_USER_CA_KEYS_FILENAME`: **`RUN_USER`/.ssh/gitea-trusted-user-ca-keys.pem**: Absolute path of the `TrustedUserCaKeys` file Gitea will manage. If you're running your own ssh server and you want to use the Gitea managed file you'll also need to modify your sshd_config to point to this file. The official docker image will automatically work without further configuration.
- `SSH_AUTHORIZED_PRINCIPALS_ALLOW`: **off** or **username, email**: \[off, username, email, anything\]: Specify the principals values that users are allowed to use as principal. When set to `anything` no checks are done on the principal string. When set to `off` authorized principal are not allowed to be set.

- `ENABLE_ACME`: **false**: Flag to enable automatic certificate management via an ACME capable Certificate Authority (CA) server (default: Lets Encrypt). If enabled, `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` are ignored, and the CA must resolve `DOMAIN` to this gitea server. Ensure that DNS records are set and either port `80` or port `443` are accessible by the CA server (the public internet by default), and redirected to the appropriate ports `PORT_TO_REDIRECT` or `HTTP_PORT` respectively.
- `ACME_URL`: **\<empty\>**: The CA's ACME directory URL, e.g. for a self-hosted [smallstep CA server](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates), it can look like `https://ca.example.com/acme/acme/directory`. If left empty, it defaults to using Let's Encerypt's production CA (check `LETSENCRYPT_ACCEPTTOS` as well).
- `ACME_ACCEPTTOS`: **false**: This is an explicit check that you accept the terms of service of the ACME provider. The default is Lets Encrypt [terms of service](https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf).

- `ALLOW_GRACEFUL_RESTARTS`: **true**: Perform a graceful restart on SIGHUP
- `GRACEFUL_HAMMER_TIME`: **60s**: After a restart the parent process will stop accepting new connections and will allow requests to finish before stopping. Shutdown will be forced if it takes longer than this time.
- `STARTUP_TIMEOUT`: **0**: Shutsdown the server if startup takes longer than the provided time. On Windows setting this sends a waithint to the SVC host to tell the SVC host startup may take some time. Please note startup is determined by the opening of the listeners - HTTP/HTTPS/SSH. Indexers may take longer to startup and can have their own timeouts.

## Database (`database`)

- `DB_TYPE`: **mysql**: The database type in use \[mysql, postgres, mssql, sqlite3\].

See your system documentation for instructions on how to add a CA certificate to the certificate store.
    - `false`: Disable TLS.
    - `disable`: Alias for `false`, for compatibility with PostgreSQL.
    - `skip-verify`: Enable TLS without database server certificate verification. Use this option if you have self-signed or invalid certificate on the database server.

## Queue (`queue` and `queue.*`)

Configuration at `[queue]` will set defaults for queues with overrides for individual queues at `[queue.*]`. (However see below.)

- `TYPE`: **level**: General queue type, currently support: `level` (uses a LevelDB internally), `channel`, `redis`, `dummy`. Invalid types are treated as `level`.

   WARNING: Custom Git Hooks can be used to perform arbitrary code execution on the host operating system.
   This enables the users to access and modify this config file and the Gitea database and interrupt the Gitea service.
   By modifying the Gitea database, users can gain Gitea administrator privileges.
   It also enables them to access other resources available to the user on the operating system that is running the
   Gitea instance and perform arbitrary actions in the name of the Gitea OS user.
   This maybe harmful to you website or your operating system.
   Setting this to true does not change existing hooks in git repos; adjust it before if necessary.
- `DISABLE_WEBHOOKS`: **false**: Set to `true` to disable webhooks feature.
- `ONLY_ALLOW_PUSH_IF_GITEA_ENVIRONMENT_SET`: **true**: Set to `false` to allow local users to push to gitea-repositories without setting up the Gitea environment. This is not recommended and if you want local users to push to Gitea repositories you should set the environment appropriately.

- `PASSWORD_HASH_ALGO`: **pbkdf2**: The hash algorithm to use \[argon2, pbkdf2, pbkdf2_v1, pbkdf2_hi, scrypt, bcrypt\], argon2 and scrypt will spend significant amounts of memory.
  - Note: The default parameters for `pbkdf2` hashing have changed - the previous settings are available as `pbkdf2_v1` but are not recommended.
  - The hash functions may be tuned by using `$` after the algorithm:
    - `argon2$<time>$<memory>$<threads>$<key-length>`
    - `bcrypt$<cost>`
    - `pbkdf2$<iterations>$<key-length>`
    - `scrypt$<n>$<r>$<p>$<key-length>`
  - The defaults are:
    - `argon2`:    `argon2$2$65536$8$50`

  - spec - use one or more special characters as ``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~``
  - off - do not check password complexity
- `PASSWORD_CHECK_PWN`: **false**: Check [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) to see if a password has been exposed.
- `SUCCESSFUL_TOKENS_CACHE_SIZE`: **20**: Cache successful token hashes. API tokens are stored in the DB as pbkdf2 hashes however, this means that there is a potentially significant hashing load when there are multiple API operations. This cache will store the successfully hashed tokens in a LRU cache as a balance between performance and security.

## Markup (`markup`)

- `MERMAID_MAX_SOURCE_CHARACTERS`: **5000**: Set the maximum size of a Mermaid source. (Set to -1 to disable)

Gitea can support Markup using external tools. The example below will add a markup named `asciidoc`.

```ini
[markup.asciidoc]
ENABLED = true
NEED_POSTPROCESS = true
FILE_EXTENSIONS = .adoc,.asciidoc
RENDER_COMMAND = "asciidoc --out-file=- -"
IS_INPUT_FILE = false
```

- ENABLED: **false** Enable markup support; set to **true** to enable this renderer.
- NEED\_POSTPROCESS: **true** set to **true** to replace links / sha1 and etc.
- FILE\_EXTENSIONS: **\<empty\>** List of file extensions that should be rendered by an external
   command. Multiple extensions needs a comma as splitter.
- RENDER\_COMMAND: External command to render all matching extensions.
- IS\_INPUT\_FILE: **false** Input is not a standard input but a file param followed `RENDER_COMMAND`.
- RENDER_CONTENT_MODE: **sanitized** How the content will be rendered.
  - sanitized: Sanitize the content and render it inside current page, default to only allow a few HTML tags and attributes. Customized sanitizer rules can be defined in `[markup.sanitizer.*]`.
  - no-sanitizer: Disable the sanitizer and render the content inside current page. It's **insecure** and may lead to XSS attack if the content contains malicious code.
  - iframe: Render the content in a separate standalone page and embed it into current page by iframe. The iframe is in sandbox mode with same-origin disabled, and the JS code are safely isolated from parent page.

Two special environment variables are passed to the render command:

- `GITEA_PREFIX_SRC`, which contains the current URL prefix in the `src` path tree. To be used as prefix for links.
- `GITEA_PREFIX_RAW`, which contains the current URL prefix in the `raw` path tree. To be used as prefix for image paths.

If `RENDER_CONTENT_MODE` is `sanitized`, Gitea supports customizing the sanitization policy for rendered HTML. The example below will support KaTeX output from pandoc.

```ini
[markup.sanitizer.TeX]
; Pandoc renders TeX segments as <span>s with the "math" class, optionally
; with "inline" or "display" classes depending on context.
ELEMENT = span
ALLOW_ATTR = class
REGEXP = ^\s*((math(\s+|$)|inline(\s+|$)|display(\s+|$)))+
ALLOW_DATA_URI_IMAGES = true
```

- `ELEMENT`: The element this policy applies to. Must be non-empty.
- `ALLOW_ATTR`: The attribute this policy allows. Must be non-empty.
- `REGEXP`: A regex to match the contents of the attribute against. Must be present but may be empty for unconditional whitelisting of this attribute.
- `ALLOW_DATA_URI_IMAGES`: **false** Allow data uri images (`<img src="data:image/png;base64,..."/>`).

Multiple sanitisation rules can be defined by adding unique subsections, e.g. `[markup.sanitizer.TeX-2]`.
To apply a sanitisation rules only for a specify external renderer they must use the renderer name, e.g. `[markup.sanitizer.asciidoc.rule-1]`.
If the rule is defined above the renderer ini section or the name does not match a renderer it is applied to every renderer.

## Highlight Mappings (`highlight.mapping`)

- `file_extension e.g. .toml`: **language e.g. ini**. File extension to language mapping overrides.

- Gitea will highlight files using the `linguist-language` or `gitlab-language` attribute from the `.gitattributes` file
if available. If this is not set or the language is unavailable, the file extension will be looked up
in this mapping or the filetype using heuristics.

## Time (`time`)

- `DEFAULT_UI_LOCATION`: Default location of time on the UI, so that we can display correct user's time on UI. i.e. Asia/Shanghai

MINIO_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY = false
```

And used by `[attachment]`, `[lfs]` and etc. as `STORAGE_TYPE`.

## Repository Archive Storage (`storage.repo-archive`)

- `PROXY_URL`: **\<empty\>**: Proxy server URL, support http://, https//, socks://, blank will follow environment http_proxy/https_proxy
- `PROXY_HOSTS`: **\<empty\>**: Comma separated list of host names requiring proxy. Glob patterns (*) are accepted; use ** to match all hosts.

i.e.

```ini
PROXY_ENABLED = true
PROXY_URL = socks://127.0.0.1:1080
PROXY_HOSTS = *.github.com
```

## Actions (`actions`)

- `ENABLED`: **false**: Enable/Disable actions capabilities
- `DEFAULT_ACTIONS_URL`: **https://gitea.com**: Default address to get action plugins, e.g. the default value means downloading from "<https://gitea.com/actions/checkout>" for "uses: actions/checkout@v3"

`DEFAULT_ACTIONS_URL` indicates where should we find the relative path action plugin. i.e. when use an action in a workflow file like

```yaml
name: versions
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - releases/*
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

Now we need to know how to get actions/checkout, this configuration is the default git server to get it. That means we will get the repository via git clone ${DEFAULT_ACTIONS_URL}/actions/checkout and fetch tag v3.

To help people who don't want to mirror these actions in their git instances, the default value is https://gitea.com
To help people run actions totally in their network, they can change the value and copy all necessary action repositories into their git server.

Of course we should support the form in future PRs like

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: gitea.com/actions/checkout@v3
```

although Github don't support this form.
