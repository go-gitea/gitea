# Configuration Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet for the Gitea configuration file. It contains most of the settings
that can be configured as well as their default values.

Any changes to the Gitea configuration file should be made in `custom/conf/app.ini`
or any corresponding location. When installing from a distribution, this will
typically be found at `/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini`.

The defaults provided here are best-effort (not built automatically). They are
accurately recorded in [app.ini.sample](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/custom/conf/app.ini.sample)
(s/master/\<tag|release\>). Any string in the format `%(X)s` is a feature powered
by [ini](https://github.com/go-ini/ini/#recursive-values), for reading values recursively.

Values containing `#` or `;` must be quoted using `` ` `` or `"""`.

**Note:** A full restart is required for Gitea configuration changes to take effect.

## Overall (`DEFAULT`)

- `APP_NAME`: **Gitea: Git with a cup of tea**: Application name, used in the page title.
- `RUN_USER`: **git**: The user Gitea will run as. This should be a dedicated system
   (non-user) account. Setting this incorrectly will cause Gitea to not start.
- `RUN_MODE`: **dev**: For performance and other purposes, change this to `prod` when
   deployed to a production environment. The installation process will set this to `prod`
   automatically. \[prod, dev, test\]

## Repository (`repository`)

- `ROOT`: **~/gitea-repositories/**: Root path for storing all repository data. It must be
   an absolute path.

   testing starts hanging.

## Markup (`markup`)

Gitea can support Markup using external tools. The example below will add a markup named `asciidoc`.

```ini
[markup.asciidoc]
ENABLED = true
FILE_EXTENSIONS = .adoc,.asciidoc
RENDER_COMMAND = "asciidoc --out-file=- -"
IS_INPUT_FILE = false
```

- ENABLED: **false** Enable markup support; set to **true** to enable this renderer.
- FILE\_EXTENSIONS: **\<empty\>** List of file extensions that should be rendered by an external
   command. Multiple extentions needs a comma as splitter.
- RENDER\_COMMAND: External command to render all matching extensions.
- IS\_INPUT\_FILE: **false** Input is not a standard input but a file param followed `RENDER_COMMAND`.

Two special environment variables are passed to the render command:
- `GITEA_PREFIX_SRC`, which contains the current URL prefix in the `src` path tree. To be used as prefix for links.
- `GITEA_PREFIX_RAW`, which contains the current URL prefix in the `raw` path tree. To be used as prefix for image paths.


Gitea supports customizing the sanitization policy for rendered HTML. The example below will support KaTeX output from pandoc.

```ini
[markup.sanitizer]
; Pandoc renders TeX segments as <span>s with the "math" class, optionally
; with "inline" or "display" classes depending on context.
ELEMENT = span
ALLOW_ATTR = class
REGEXP = ^\s*((math(\s+|$)|inline(\s+|$)|display(\s+|$)))+
```

 - `ELEMENT`: The element this policy applies to. Must be non-empty.
 - `ALLOW_ATTR`: The attribute this policy allows. Must be non-empty.
 - `REGEXP`: A regex to match the contents of the attribute against. Must be present but may be empty for unconditional whitelisting of this attribute.

You may redefine `ELEMENT`, `ALLOW_ATTR`, and `REGEXP` multiple times; each time all three are defined is a single policy entry.
