# Configuration Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet for the Gitea configuration file. It contains most of the settings
that can be configured as well as their default values.

Any changes to the Gitea configuration file should be made in `custom/conf/app.ini`
or any corresponding location. When installing from a distribution, this will
typically be found at `/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini`.

The defaults provided here are best-effort (not built automatically). They are
accurately recorded in [app.example.ini](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/custom/conf/app.example.ini)
(s/master/\<tag|release\>). Any string in the format `%(X)s` is a feature powered
by [ini](https://github.com/go-ini/ini/#recursive-values), for reading values recursively.

Values containing `#` or `;` must be quoted using `` ` `` or `"""`.

**Note:** A full restart is required for Gitea configuration changes to take effect.

## Overall (`DEFAULT`)

- `APP_NAME`: **Gitea: Git with a cup of tea**: Application name, used in the page title.
- `RUN_USER`: **git**: The user Gitea will run as. This should be a dedicated system
   (non-user) account. Setting this incorrectly will cause Gitea to not start.
- `RUN_MODE`: **dev**: For performance and other purposes, change this to `prod` when
   deployed to a production environment. The installation process will set this to `prod`
   automatically. \[prod, dev, test\]

## Repository (`repository`)

- `ROOT`: **~/gitea-repositories/**: Root path for storing all repository data. It must be
   an absolute path.
- `SCRIPT_TYPE`: **bash**: The script type this server supports. Usually this is `bash`,
   but some users report that only `sh` is available.
- `DETECTED_CHARSETS_ORDER`: **UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, ISO-8859, windows-1252, ISO-8859, windows-1250, ISO-8859, ISO-8859, ISO-8859, windows-1253, ISO-8859, windows-1255, ISO-8859, windows-1251, windows-1256, KOI8-R, ISO-8859, windows-1254, Shift_JIS, GB18030, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, Big5, ISO-2022, ISO-2022, ISO-2022, IBM424_rtl, IBM424_ltr, IBM420_rtl, IBM420_ltr**: Tie-break order of detected charsets - if the detected charsets have equal confidence, charsets earlier in the list will be chosen in preference to those later. Adding `defaults` will place the unnamed charsets at that point.
- `ANSI_CHARSET`: **\<empty\>**: Default ANSI charset to override non-UTF-8 charsets to.

If you're running your own ssh server and you want to use the gitea managed file you'll also need to modify your sshd_config to point to this file. The official docker image will automatically work without further configuration.
- `SSH_AUTHORIZED_PRINCIPALS_ALLOW`: **off** or **username, email**: \[off, username, email, anything\]: Specify the principals values that users are allowed to use as principal.

## Markup (`markup`)

Gitea can support Markup using external tools. The example below will add a markup named `asciidoc`.

```ini
[markup.asciidoc]
ENABLED = true
FILE_EXTENSIONS = .adoc,.asciidoc
RENDER_COMMAND = "asciidoc --out-file=- -"
IS_INPUT_FILE = false
```

- ENABLED: **false** Enable markup support; set to **true** to enable this renderer.
- FILE\_EXTENSIONS: **\<empty\>** List of file extensions that should be rendered by an external
   command. Multiple extentions needs a comma as splitter.
- RENDER\_COMMAND: External command to render all matching extensions.
- IS\_INPUT\_FILE: **false** Input is not a standard input but a file param followed `RENDER_COMMAND`.

Two special environment variables are passed to the render command:
- `GITEA_PREFIX_SRC`, which contains the current URL prefix in the `src` path tree. To be used as prefix for links.
- `GITEA_PREFIX_RAW`, which contains the current URL prefix in the `raw` path tree. To be used as prefix for image paths.


Gitea supports customizing the sanitization policy for rendered HTML. The example below will support KaTeX output from pandoc.

```ini
[markup.sanitizer.TeX]
; Pandoc renders TeX segments as <span>s with the "math" class, optionally
; with "inline" or "display" classes depending on context.
ELEMENT = span
ALLOW_ATTR = class
REGEXP = ^\s*((math(\s+|$)|inline(\s+|$)|display(\s+|$)))+
```

 - `ELEMENT`: The element this policy applies to. Must be non-empty.
 - `ALLOW_ATTR`: The attribute this policy allows. Must be non-empty.
 - `REGEXP`: A regex to match the contents of the attribute against. Must be present but may be empty for unconditional whitelisting of this attribute.

Multiple sanitisation rules can be defined by adding unique subsections, e.g. `[markup.sanitizer.TeX-2]`.

## Time (`time`)

- `FORMAT`: Time format to diplay on UI. i.e. RFC1123 or 2006-01-02 15:04:05
- `DEFAULT_UI_LOCATION`: Default location of time on the UI, so that we can display correct user's time on UI. i.e. Shanghai/Asia

## Task (`task`)

Task queue configuration has been moved to `queue.task`. However, the below configuration values are kept for backwards compatibility:

- `QUEUE_TYPE`: **channel**: Task queue type, could be `channel` or `redis`.
- `QUEUE_LENGTH`: **1000**: Task queue length, available only when `QUEUE_TYPE` is `channel`.
- `QUEUE_CONN_STR`: **redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0**: Task queue connection string, available only when `QUEUE_TYPE` is `redis`. If redis needs a password, use `redis://123@127.0.0.1:6379/0`.

## Migrations (`migrations`)

- `RETRY_BACKOFF`: **3**: Backoff time per http/https request retry (seconds)

## Mirror (`mirror`)

`[storage.xxx]` when set `STORAGE_TYPE` to `xxx`. When derived, the default of `PATH` 
is `data/lfs` and the default of `MINIO_BASE_PATH` is `lfs/`.

- `STORAGE_TYPE`: **local**: Storage type for lfs, `local` for local disk or `minio` for s3 compatible object storage service or other name defined with `[storage.xxx]`
- `SERVE_DIRECT`: **false**: Allows the storage driver to redirect to authenticated URLs to serve files directly. Currently, only Minio/S3 is supported via signed URLs, local does nothing.

## Storage (`storage`)

Default storage configuration for attachments, lfs, avatars and etc.

- `SERVE_DIRECT`: **false**: Allows the storage driver to redirect to authenticated URLs to serve files directly. Currently, only Minio/S3 is supported via signed URLs, local does nothing.
- `MINIO_ENDPOINT`: **localhost:9000**: Minio endpoint to connect only available when `STORAGE_TYPE` is `minio`
- `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Minio accessKeyID to connect only available when `STORAGE_TYPE` is `minio`
- `MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Minio secretAccessKey to connect only available when `STORAGE_TYPE is` `minio`
- `MINIO_BUCKET`: **gitea**: Minio bucket to store the data only available when `STORAGE_TYPE` is `minio`
- `MINIO_LOCATION`: **us-east-1**: Minio location to create bucket only available when `STORAGE_TYPE` is `minio`
- `MINIO_USE_SSL`: **false**: Minio enabled ssl only available when `STORAGE_TYPE` is `minio`

And you can also define a customize storage like below:

```ini
[storage.my_minio]
STORAGE_TYPE = minio
; Minio endpoint to connect only available when STORAGE_TYPE is `minio`
MINIO_ENDPOINT = localhost:9000
; Minio accessKeyID to connect only available when STORAGE_TYPE is `minio`
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID =
; Minio secretAccessKey to connect only available when STORAGE_TYPE is `minio`
MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY =
; Minio bucket to store the attachments only available when STORAGE_TYPE is `minio`
MINIO_BUCKET = gitea
; Minio location to create bucket only available when STORAGE_TYPE is `minio`
MINIO_LOCATION = us-east-1
; Minio enabled ssl only available when STORAGE_TYPE is `minio`
MINIO_USE_SSL = false
```

And used by `[attachment]`, `[lfs]` and etc. as `STORAGE_TYPE`.
