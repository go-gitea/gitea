// Bash has the definition of a metacharacter:
// * A character that, when unquoted, separates words.
//   A metacharacter is one of: " \t\n|&;()<>"
//
// The following characters also have addition special meaning when unescaped:
// * ‘${[*?!"'`\’
//
// Double Quotes preserve the literal value of all characters with then quotes
// excepting: ‘$’, ‘`’, ‘\’, and, when history expansion is enabled, ‘!’.
// The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the
// following characters: ‘$’, ‘`’, ‘"’, ‘\’, or newline.
// Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left
// unmodified. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding
// it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless
// an ‘!’ appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The
// backslash preceding the ‘!’ is not removed.
//
// -> This means that `!\n` cannot be safely expressed in `"`.
//
// Looking at the man page for Dash and ash the situation is similar.
//
// Now zsh requires that ‘}’, and ‘]’ are also enclosed in doublequotes or escaped
//
// Single quotes escape everything except a ‘'’
//
// There's one other gotcha - ‘~’ at the start of a string needs to be expanded
// because people always expect that - of course if there is a special character before '/'
// this is not going to work
