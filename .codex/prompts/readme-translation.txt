Your task is translate `README.md` into several languages. The translation should sound natural and easy to read.
Target languages: Chinese (zh-cn), Chinese (zh-tw), Japanese (ja-JP)
Use the following format for each translation: `README.{language_code}-{country_code}.md`
Rules:
- Clone the repository from https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea and create a new branch for your work
- If a translation file already exists, only update the changes
- If a translation file does not exist, create a new one and add the link in `README.md` and each translated readme file
- Do not modify the original `README.md` file
