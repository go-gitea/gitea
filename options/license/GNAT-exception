As a special exception, if other files instantiate generics from this
unit, or you link this unit with other files to produce an executable,
this unit does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be
covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
covered by the GNU Public License.
