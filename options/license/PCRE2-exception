EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.
