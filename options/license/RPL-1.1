Inc., All Rights Reserved. PREAMBLE

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature, intent,
and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this License.
The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License
and not this Preamble.

This License is based on the concept of reciprocity. In exchange for being
granted certain rights under the terms of this License to Licensor's Software,
whose Source Code You have access to, You are required to reciprocate by providing
equal access and rights to all third parties to the Source Code of any Modifications,
Derivative Works, and Required Components for execution of same (collectively
defined as Extensions) that You Deploy by Deploying Your Extensions under
the terms of this License. In this fashion the available Source Code related
to the original Licensed Software is enlarged for the benefit of everyone.

Under the terms of this License You may:

a. Distribute the Licensed Software exactly as You received it under the terms
of this License either alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution
containing programs from several different sources without payment of a royalty
or other fee.

b. Use the Licensed Software for any purpose consistent with the rights granted
by this License, but the Licensor is not providing You any warranty whatsoever,
nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed
Software doesn't work properly or causes You any injury or damages.

c. Create Extensions to the Licensed Software consistent with the rights granted
by this License, provided that You make the Source Code to any Extensions
You Deploy available to all third parties under the terms of this License,
document Your Modifications clearly, and title all Extensions distinctly from
the Licensed Software.

d. Charge a fee for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
obligations for Your customers.

Under the terms of this License You may not:

a. Charge for the Source Code to the Licensed Software, or Your Extensions,
other than a nominal fee not to exceed Your cost for reproduction and distribution
where such reproduction and distribution involve physical media.

b. Modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices, or
License text in the Licensed Software.

c. Assert any patent claims against the Licensor or Contributors, or which
would in any way restrict the ability of any third party to use the Licensed
Software or portions thereof in any form under the terms of this License,
or Your rights to the Licensed Software under this License automatically terminate.

d. Represent either expressly or by implication, appearance, or otherwise
that You represent Licensor or

Contributors in any capacity or that You have any form of legal association
by virtue of this License.

Under the terms of this License You must:

a. Document any Modifications You make to the Licensed Software including
the nature of the change, the authors of the change, and the date of the change.
This documentation must appear both in the Source Code and in a text file
titled "CHANGES" distributed with the Licensed Software and Your Extensions.

b. Make the Source Code for any Extensions You Deploy available in a timely
fashion via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism such as FTP or HTTP download.

c. Notify the Licensor of the availability of Source Code to Your Extensions
in a timely fashion and include in such notice a brief description of the
Extensions, the distinctive title used, and instructions on how to acquire
the Source Code and future updates.

d. Grant Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You
to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute Your
Extensions, in any form, under the terms of this License.

other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly
stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent
rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require
additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant

grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed Software
set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor
that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim
any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising
the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the
Licensed Software, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Licensed Software.

6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express condition
to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree that any
Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively Extensions)
that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions that You
create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of this
License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You
hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or control
to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, sublicense,
and distribute Your Extensions, in any form. Any Extensions You make and Deploy
must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any subsequent user or Contributor
that the Extensions are by You. You must include a copy of this License with
every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose
any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software,
or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License
or the recipients' rights hereunder.

6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms
of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Software and any Extensions
that You Deploy, either on the same media as You distribute any executable
or other form of the Licensed Software, or via an Electronic Distribution
Mechanism. The Source Code for any version of Licensed Software, or its Extensions
that You Deploy must be made available at the time of Deployment and must
remain available for as long as You Deploy the Extensions or at least twelve
(12) months after the date You Deploy, whichever is longer. You are responsible
for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge
a fee for the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your
actual cost of duplication and distribution where such duplication and distribution
involve physical media.

6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You
create or to which You contribute, to update the file titled "CHANGES" distributed
with Licensed Software documenting the additions, changes or deletions You
made, the authors of such Modifications, and the dates of any such additions,
changes or deletions. You must also cause a cross-reference to appear in the
Source Code at the location of each change. You must include a prominent statement
that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed
Software and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the
Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed
by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related documentation in which
You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Software. You may not
modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, change notices or License
text in the Licensed Software.

      6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.

a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party's
intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by
this License, You must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If You obtain
such knowledge after You make any Extensions available as described in Section
6.1, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing
lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Licensed Software from You that new knowledge has been obtained.

b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming
interface ("API") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably
necessary to implement that API, You must also include this information in
the LEGAL file.

c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a)
above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original creations
and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      6.4 Required Notices.

a. License Text. You must duplicate this License in any documentation You
provide along with the Source Code of any Extensions You create or to which
You contribute, wherever You describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed
Software. You must duplicate the notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the "Notice")
in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed
Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You may add Your
name as a Contributor to the text file titled "CONTRIB" distributed with the
Licensed Software along with a description of the contribution. If it is not
possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
then You must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

b. Source Code Availability. You must notify Licensor within one (1) month
of the date You initially Deploy of the availability of Source Code to Your
Extensions and include in such notification the name under which you Deployed
Your Extensions, a description of the Extensions, and instructions on how
to acquire the Source Code, including instructions on how to acquire updates
over time. Should such instructions change you must provide Licensor with
revised instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. Should you
be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting
to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine
would reasonably be expected to index them.

6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability
plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or
claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by
virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance,
fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should
be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this
License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms
of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve
the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this
License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised
and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published
under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed
Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Licensed Software created under this License.

7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may
do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software
under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly
similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains
terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not
use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications
to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes
of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer
to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.

8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE
OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims
warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to
be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties
of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against
use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed
all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You
agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including
Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute
any admission of liability.

12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate
immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or
if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically
complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any
of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed
Software.

12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware
of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly
granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.

12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation
by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You
file such an action is referred to herein as "Respondent") alleging that Licensed
Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall
terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice
Period") unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i)
to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or
future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw
Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent.
If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and
4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.

12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement
claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly
infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall
be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.

12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors
and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
prior to termination shall survive termination.

   13.0 Miscellaneous.

to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwise.

13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's
right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology
or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete
with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce
any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement
of that or any other provision.

13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
to make it enforceable.

13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible
for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation,
then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software.

13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading
or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or
any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable
laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed

award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent
jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's
fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor
expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed
Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language
of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
License.
