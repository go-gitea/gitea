This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license
can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that
ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise,
this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve
the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
under the Open Source Definition.
