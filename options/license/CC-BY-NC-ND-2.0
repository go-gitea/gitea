License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats,
but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited
to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested.

b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You
are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original
Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented
in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

      d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

i. Performancf Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever
in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or
any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without
limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences,
if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder,
it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons"
or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written
consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with
