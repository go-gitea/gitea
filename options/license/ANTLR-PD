ANTLR 2 License

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain.
An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed
with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that
credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you
use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial
product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere
in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed
a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR.
In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As
long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system
and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.
