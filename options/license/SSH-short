As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software can be
used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions of this software must be
clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is incompatible with the protocol
description in the RFC file, it must be called by a name other than "ssh"
or "Secure Shell".
