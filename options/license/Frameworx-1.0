4. Restrictions on Open Downstream Distributions. Each Downstream Distribution
made by You, and by any party directly or indirectly obtaining rights to the
Frameworx Code Base through You, shall be made subject to a license grant
or agreement to the extent necessary so that each distributee under that Downstream
Distribution will be subject to the same restrictions on re-distribution and
use as are binding on You hereunder. You may satisfy this licensing requirement
either by:

(a) requiring as a condition to any Downstream Distribution made by you, or
by any direct or indirect distributee of Your Downstream Distribution (or
any portion or element thereof), that each distributee under the relevant
Downstream Distribution obtain a direct license (on the same terms and conditions
as those in this License Agreement) from The Frameworx Company; or

(b) sub-licensing all (and not less than all) of Your rights and obligations
hereunder to that distributee, including (without limitation) Your obligation
to require distributees to be bound by license restrictions as contemplated
by this Section 4 above.

The Frameworx Company hereby grants to you all rights to sub-license your
rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the intent and purpose of this
Section 4 above, provided, however, that your rights and obligations hereunder
shall be unaffected by any such sublicensing. In addition, The Frameworx Company
expressly retains all rights to take all appropriate action (including legal
action) against any such direct or indirect sub-licensee to ensure its full
compliance with the intent and purposes of this License Agreement.

5. Intellectual Property. Except as expressly provided herein, this License
Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx Companys respective
intellectual property rights, including, in the case of The Frameworx Company,
its copyrights and patent rights relating to the Frameworx Code Base.

6. Warranty Disclaimer. THE SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED ``AS IS.''

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT,

LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER
CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

7. License Violation. The License, and all of your rights thereunder, shall
be deemed automatically terminated and void as of any Downstream Distribution
directly or indirectly made or facilitated by You that violates the provisions
of this License Agreement, provided, however, that this License Agreement
shall survive any such termination in order to remedy the effects of such
violation. This License Agreement shall be binding on the legal successors
and assigns of the parties hereto.

Your agreement to the foregoing as of the date hereof has been evidenced by
your acceptance of the relevant software distribution hereunder. (C) THE FRAMEWORX
