Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License

Version 1.1

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN
SOURCE LICENSE ("LICENSE"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe
that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs
to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate
our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as
defined below) under this License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program
to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of
the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying
Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain
open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software
programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your
Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which
you may use the Program.

   1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b)
in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the
Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties.
A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions
do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.

1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the
Program.

1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program
that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made
to the Program thereafter.

1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof
with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed
by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this
License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code
and documentation, if any.

      1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.

1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.

   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute
and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the
license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed
Patents of a Contributor.

2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed
Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import
the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code
form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination
of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed
Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that
do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance
with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications
of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made
by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor
Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed
by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.

2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property
rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title
and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to
grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.

   3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice
must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation,
stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor
with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor
may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license
agreement, provided that:

         * it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and

         * its license agreement:

* effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;

* effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages,
such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;

* states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

* states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor
at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner.

      3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:

         * it must be made available under this License; and

* a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of
the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients
a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors
may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing
royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the
Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version
they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor
to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License
to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance
that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not
an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties
or other recurring fees for the Program itself.

3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other
software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make
sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program.
Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other
Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited
to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors
behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to
the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor
to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual
commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution
of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the
Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in
writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates
Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com,
both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter.
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available,
Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor
makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor
copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether
in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the
obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself
as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably
allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides
a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made
to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor
must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived,
directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor,
including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was
derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable
version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin
or ownership of the Program.

5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION,
CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,

OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED
BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS
AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage
to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption
of operations.

5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in
the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems,
or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could
lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE
OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

   7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights
to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm,
or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to
CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade
name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks
in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or
to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program.

7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks,
logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright
and other attribution notices remain in the Program.

   8. PATENT LITIGATION

8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under
Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   9. OWNERSHIP

9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and
2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and
to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title
and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by
or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not
be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion,
choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different
terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them
at all.

   10. TERMINATION

10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails

of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses
granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue
and survive termination.

   11. GENERAL

provision valid and enforceable.

11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from
time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed
subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition,

distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.

11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of
this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this
License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file
described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the
Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
