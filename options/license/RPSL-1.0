RealNetworks Public Source License Version 1.0

(Rev. Date October 28, 2002)

1. General Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work
which RealNetworks, Inc., or any other entity that elects to use this license,
("Licensor") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by
Licensor identifying such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that
it is subject to the terms of this RealNetworks Public Source License version
1.0 (or subsequent version thereof) ("License"). You are not required to accept
this License. However, nothing else grants You permission to use, copy, modify
or distribute the software or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
by law if You do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying
or distributing the software (or any work based on the software), You indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions.
In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by clicking the Accept
button or downloading the software. As used in this License:

1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Licensor is the
grantor of rights, claims of patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired,
owned by or assigned to Licensor and (ii) are necessarily infringed by using
or making the Original Code alone and not in combination with other software
or hardware; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, claims
of patents that (i) are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to
You and (ii) are infringed (directly or indirectly) by using or making Your
Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.

1.2 "Compatible Source License" means any one of the licenses listed on Exhibit
B or at https://www.helixcommunity.org/content/complicense or other licenses
specifically identified by Licensor in writing. Notwithstanding any term to
the contrary in any Compatible Source License, any code covered by any Compatible
Source License that is used with Covered Code must be made readily available
in Source Code format for royalty-free use under the terms of the Compatible
Source License or this License.

1.3 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to
the creation of Modifications.

1.4 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination
of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.

1.5 "Deploy" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than
for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal Use, and
includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered
Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use and/or Personal
Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered
Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.

1.6 "Derivative Work" means either the Covered Code or any derivative work
under United States copyright law, and including any work containing or including
any portion of the Covered Code or Modifications, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. Derivative Work also
includes any work which combines any portion of Covered Code or Modifications
with code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License.

1.7 "Externally Deploy" means to Deploy the Covered Code in any way that may
be accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to provide any services
to anyone other than You, or used in any way to deliver any content to anyone
other than You, whether the Covered Code is distributed to those parties,
made available as an application intended for use over a computer network,
or used to provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than
You.

1.8. "Interface" means interfaces, functions, properties, class definitions,
APIs, header files, GUIDs, V-Tables, and/or protocols allowing one piece of
software, firmware or hardware to communicate or interoperate with another
piece of software, firmware or hardware.

1.9 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to,
the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications,
the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any
respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a
Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of
computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

1.10 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work
as originally made available by Licensor under this License, including the
Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available
by Licensor under this License, and that has been expressly identified by
Licensor as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code
compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Licensor under
this License.

1.11 "Personal Use" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely for
his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An individual's
use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer, employee, member,
independent contractor or agent of a corporation, business or organization
(commercial or non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.

1.12 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work
that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to
control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).

1.13 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your" includes any entity
which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where
"control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction
or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership
of such entity.

2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept
this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating
your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
copyright license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover the Original
Code, to do the following:

2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided
that in each instance:

(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright
and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in
the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer
to this License;

(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code
of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or
impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or
the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6;

(c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice
in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and
cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
the files and the date of any change;

(d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications
publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license
grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered
Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever
is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed
Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and

(e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must
include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms
of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.
You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the
"about" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are placed,
including any packaging materials.

2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor
grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth
herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the
Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights
of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability
to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure
any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third
party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import or
offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such
license(s).

2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using
Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide,
royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor's Applicable
Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Covered Code,
provided that in each instance you comply with the terms of this License.

3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
to You under this License:

(a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and
other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell,
offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute
and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses
under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and

(b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent
Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You,
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute,
modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense
and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose, through
multiple tiers of distribution.

(c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of
the Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions
that may be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any
of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent
rights, against Licensor or any Contributor.

4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered
Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.

4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or Externally
Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Code
or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License and no other license except as provided in
Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative Work
under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3, above.

4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently
developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of
the Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or
combined in any way with the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a
larger Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section
4.1 but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software
that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the
software module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible
Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject
to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed
under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source
License for any independently developed software modules within the Derivative
Work. The foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License
would ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works
with, other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License.
For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code
to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if
MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not
be combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent
of this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that
are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible
for determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed
under Your license to such software.

4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the
Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and/or integration
with an application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic
updating technology), such combination and/or integration constitutes a Derivative
Work subject to the terms of this License.

5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed
to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly
stated herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor
even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms
from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of Covered Code
with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may require additional
patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion.
No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or combinations
of the Original Code with other software or hardware.

5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
or trade names owned by Licensor ("Licensor Marks" defined in Exhibit C) or
to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks
may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code
other than as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit
C.

6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf
and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor.
You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor
and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted
against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version
of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version.
You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent
version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under
this License.

8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain
errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or
contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the
Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT
OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED
TO AS "LICENSOR" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY,
OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND
EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT
OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL
MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED
OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL
OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You
acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk activities,
including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems,
or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code
could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for
such uses.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER
UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor's total liability
to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00).

10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor
retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by
such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to
the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor ("Licensor
Modifications"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be automatically
subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion, choose to license
such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on different terms from
those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

   11. Termination.

11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless terminated
as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:

(a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with
any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of such breach;

(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b);
or

(c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during
the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against
Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit);

(d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term
of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third
party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other
software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter
claim in a lawsuit).

11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop
any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution
of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are
in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of
this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond
the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to
Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other
for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License
will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

   12. Miscellaneous.

12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined
in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software
is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer
Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical
Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software
or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End
Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating
an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not represent
to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's
right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions
as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology
or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce
any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement
of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not
apply to this License.

12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder
of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability
of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You
must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies
of it that are in your possession or control.

12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between
You and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle,
Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction
of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect
to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import
laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive
the Covered Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not
export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof
in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all
necessary authorizations.

12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of
Washington.

Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause
applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License
and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigé que
le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.
