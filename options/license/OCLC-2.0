OCLC Research Public License 2.0

Terms & Conditions Of Use

May, 2002

Copyright © 2002. OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. All Rights Reserved

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE CODE BASE
AND/OR DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE (THE "License"), YOU AGREE
TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.

Section 1. Your Rights

Subject to these terms and conditions of this License, the OCLC Office of
Research (the "Original Contributor") and each subsequent contributor (collectively
with the Original Contributor, the "Contributors") hereby grant you a non-exclusive,
worldwide, no-charge, transferable license to execute, prepare derivative
works of, and distribute (internally and externally), for commercial and noncommercial
purposes, the original code contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications
(collectively called the "Program").

Section 2. Definitions

A "Modification" to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents
of any file of the Program and any new file that contains any part of the
Program. If you make a Modification and distribute the Program externally
you are a "Contributor." The distribution of the Program must be under the
terms of this license including those in Section 3 below.

A "Combined Work" results from combining and integrating all or parts of the
Program with other code. A Combined Work may be thought of as having multiple
parents or being result of multiple lines of code development.

Section 3. Distribution Licensing Terms

   A. General Requirements

Except as necessary to recognize third-party rights or third-party restriction
(see below), a distribution of the Program in any of the forms listed below
must not put any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights
granted herein.

As a Contributor, you represent that your Modification(s) are your original
creation(s) and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim
(including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your
Modification(s). You represent that each of your Modifications includes complete
details of any third-party right or other third-party restriction associated
with any part of your Modification (including a copy of any applicable license
agreement).

The Program must be distributed without charge beyond the costs of physically
transferring the files to the recipient.

This Warranty Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability must be prominently displayed
with every distribution of the Program in any form:

YOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
(EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). ACCORDINGLY, OCLC MAKES NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS
OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO:
(A) THE FUNCTIONALITY OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED
WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK; OR (B) THE RESULTS OF ANY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN USING
THE PROGRAM, ANY MODIFICATION, A COMBINED WORK OR AN AGGREGATE WORK. IN NO
EVENT SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA,
OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES
OF ANY KIND AGAINST CONTRIBUTORS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM.

   B. Requirements for a Distribution of Modifiable Code

If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient can make Modifications
(e.g. source code), the terms of this license apply to use by recipient. In
addition, each source and data file of the Program and any Modification you
distribute must contain the following notice:

" Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library
Center, Inc. and other contributors . All rights reserved. The contents of
this file, as updated from time to time by the OCLC Office of Research, are
subject to OCLC Research Public License Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may
not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a
current copy of the License at http://purl.oclc.org/oclc/research/ORPL/. Software
distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific
language governing rights and limitations under the License. This software
consists of voluntary contributions made by many individuals on behalf of
OCLC Research. For more information on OCLC Research, please see http://www.oclc.org/research/.
The Original Code is ______________________________ . The Initial Developer
of the Original Code is ________________________ . Portions created by ______________________
are Copyright (C) ____________________________ . All Rights Reserved. Contributor(s):
______________________________________ . "

   C. Requirements for a Distribution of Non-modifiable Code

If you distribute the Program in a form to which the recipient cannot make
Modifications (e.g. object code), the terms of this license apply to use by
recipient and you must include the following statement in appropriate and
conspicuous locations:

"Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) OCLC Online Computer Library
Center, Inc. and other contributors. All rights reserved."

In addition, the source code must be included with the object code distribution
or the distributor must provide the source code to the recipient upon request.

   D. Requirements for a Combined Work Distribution

Distributions of Combined Works are subject to the terms of this license and
must be made at no charge to the recipient beyond the costs of physically
transferring the files to recipient.

A Combined Work may be distributed as either modifiable or non-modifiable
code. The requirements of Section 3.B or 3.C above (as appropriate) apply
to such distributions.

An "Aggregate Work" is when the Program exists, without integration, with
other programs on a storage medium. This License does not apply to portions
of an Aggregate Work which are not covered by the definition of "Program"
provided in this License. You are not forbidden from selling an Aggregate
Work. However, the Program contained in an Aggregate Work is subject to this
License. Also, should the Program be extracted from an Aggregate Work, this
License applies to any use of the Program apart from the Aggregate Work.

   Section 4. License Grant

For purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees
hereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute,
copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, enhance, develop, publicly
display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works
based on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with
these Terms. This Section 4 shall survive termination of this License for
any reason.

Section 5. Termination of Rights

This non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor)
automatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual
property infringement (with respect to the Program) against such Contributor
as of the initiation of such action.

If you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations)
under this License shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach
within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses
granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted shall
survive such termination.

Section 6. Other Terms

Except for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark
of any of the Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant
Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright or other
proprietary rights notice contained in the Program.

All transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance
with U.S. import/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department
of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or commerce restrictions which
might apply.

Any patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof
must include a provision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted
commercial and noncommercial use by any third party.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual
property infringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed
on you that contradict the conditions of this License, such conditions do
not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute
the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License
and such other conditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For
example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, you could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you
would be required to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program
you have already distributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address
the issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those who may have received
the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform
would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board.

The provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining
provisions which shall continue in full force and effect. In substitution
for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of
similar import reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the
extent permissible under law.

The Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the
amended license will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the
new license is posted. This License grants only the rights expressly stated
herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual
property of any Contributor.

This License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between
the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except
by the written agreement of the parties. This License shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United
States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
