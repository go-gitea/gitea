## Useful knowledge from stackoverflow
# Even if you haven't tracked the files so far, git seems to be able to "know" about them even after you add them to .gitignore.
# WARNING: First commit your current changes, or you will lose them.
# Then run the following commands from the top folder of your git repo:
# git rm -r --cached .
# git add .
# git commit -m "fixed untracked files"
