HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, was primarily designed to provide a means of creating structured scientific documents. HTML can embed scripting languages such as PHP or JavaScript to affect the behavior and content of web pages. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains both the HTML and CSS standards.
