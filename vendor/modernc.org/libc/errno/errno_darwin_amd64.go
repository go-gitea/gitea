// This SDK is designed to work with clang and specific versions of
// gcc >= 4.0 with Apple's patch sets

// Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support compiler
// feature checking function-like macros.

// The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
// with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
// The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
// in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
// strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.

// __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
// the compiler from warning about it if not used.

// __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
// to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).

// __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
// and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.

// __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering
// code using the deprecated functionality.
// __deprecated_msg() does the same, and compilers that support it will print
// a message along with the deprecation warning.
// This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
// __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
// it will print the deprecation warning.
// __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
// interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.

// __unavailable causes the compiler to error out when encountering
// code using the tagged function of variable.

// Delete pseudo-keywords wherever they are not available or needed.

// We use `__restrict' as a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier
// without disturbing older software that is unaware of C99 keywords.

// Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support the
// nullability feature.

// __disable_tail_calls causes the compiler to not perform tail call
// optimization inside the marked function.

// __not_tail_called causes the compiler to prevent tail call optimization
// on statically bound calls to the function.  It has no effect on indirect
// calls.  Virtual functions, objective-c methods, and functions marked as
// "always_inline" cannot be marked as __not_tail_called.

// __result_use_check warns callers of a function that not using the function
// return value is a bug, i.e. dismissing malloc() return value results in a
// memory leak.

// __swift_unavailable causes the compiler to mark a symbol as specifically
// unavailable in Swift, regardless of any other availability in C.

// __abortlike is the attribute to put on functions like abort() that are
// typically used to mark assertions. These optimize the codegen
// for outlining while still maintaining debugability.

// Declaring inline functions within headers is error-prone due to differences
// across various versions of the C language and extensions.  __header_inline
// can be used to declare inline functions within system headers.  In cases
// where you want to force inlining instead of letting the compiler make
// the decision, you can use __header_always_inline.
//
// Be aware that using inline for functions which compilers may also provide
// builtins can behave differently under various compilers.  If you intend to
// provide an inline version of such a function, you may want to use a macro
// instead.
//

// Compiler-dependent macros that bracket portions of code where the
// "-Wunreachable-code" warning should be ignored. Please use sparingly.

// Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
// or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
// that are known to support the features properly.  Functions declared
// with these attributes will cause compilation warnings if there is a
// mismatch between the format string and subsequent function parameter
// types.

// Source compatibility only, ID string not emitted in object file

// __alloc_size can be used to label function arguments that represent the
// size of memory that the function allocates and returns. The one-argument
// form labels a single argument that gives the allocation size (where the
// arguments are numbered from 1):
//
// void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);
//
// The two-argument form handles the case where the size is calculated as the
// product of two arguments:
//
// void	*calloc(size_t __count, size_t __size) __alloc_size(1,2);

// COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
//
// DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
//		Apple API extensions in scope.
//
//		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
//		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
//
// LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
//		API extensions in scope.
//
//		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
//		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
//		its use is discouraged.
//
//		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
//
// STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
//		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
//		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
//
//		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
//		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
//
//		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
//		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
//		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
//		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
//
// In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
// function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
// tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
// compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
// used without a prototype in scope.

// These settings are particular to each product.
// Platform: MacOSX
// #undef __DARWIN_ONLY_UNIX_CONFORMANCE (automatically set for 64-bit)

// The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
// legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
// while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
//
// __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
// changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
// if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ environment
// only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
// defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
//
// As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
// OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
// will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
// time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
// pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
// compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

// POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
// header file is included.  This permits us to convert values for feature
// testing, as necessary, using only _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
//
// Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
//  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L		1003.1-1990
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309L		1003.1b-1993
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506L		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
//					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112L		1003.1-2001
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809L		1003.1-2008
//
// In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
// Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
// that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L.

// Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec.

// Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
// important.

// Set a single macro which will always be defined and can be used to determine
// the appropriate namespace.  For POSIX, these values will correspond to
// _POSIX_C_SOURCE value.  Currently there are two additional levels corresponding
// to ANSI (_ANSI_SOURCE) and Darwin extensions (_DARWIN_C_SOURCE)

// If the developer has neither requested a strict language mode nor a version
// of POSIX, turn on functionality provided by __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as part
// of __DARWIN_C_FULL.

// long long is not supported in c89 (__STRICT_ANSI__), but g++ -ansi and
// c99 still want long longs.  While not perfect, we allow long longs for
// g++.

//  Public darwin-specific feature macros
//

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type is 64-bit, and
// structures modified for 64-bit inodes (like struct stat) will be used.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_ONLY_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type may only
// be 64-bit; there is no support for 32-bit ino_t when this macro is defined
// (and non-zero).  There is no struct stat64 either, as the regular
// struct stat will already be the 64-bit version.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_VERS_1050 indicates that only those APIs updated
// in 10.5 exists; no pre-10.5 variants are available.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates only UNIX conforming API
// are available (the legacy BSD APIs are not available)

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates whether UNIX conformance is on,
// and specifies the conformance level (3 is SUSv3)

// This macro casts away the qualifier from the variable
//
// Note: use at your own risk, removing qualifiers can result in
// catastrophic run-time failures.

// __XNU_PRIVATE_EXTERN is a linkage decoration indicating that a symbol can be
// used from other compilation units, but not other libraries or executables.

// Architecture validation for current SDK

// Similar to OS_ENUM/OS_CLOSED_ENUM/OS_OPTIONS/OS_CLOSED_OPTIONS
//
// This provides more advanced type checking on compilers supporting
// the proper extensions, even in C.
